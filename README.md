# Alienvault-hids-autodeploy

Offering a golang program to automate ossec-hids deployment on an entire subnet (or single host).
The program will be setting up an agent that allows hosts to connect to alienvault sensors via port 1514 (UDP) and send system events.
Before starting the automatic deployment of ossec-hids you will need to tune up your alienvault USM appliance and install the golang requirements for "scanner" host. The following Docs will guide you trough the process.
To run this program you will need:
* nmap >= 7.7
* go > 1.13 (installed by "scanner setup" script)
* ansible >= 2.7

## "Scanner" Setup
In order to setup the scripts on your deploy "delegated" host you will just need to run:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucabodd/Alienvault-hids-autodeploy/master/setup/hids-autodeploy-install.sh | bash
```
this script will setup golang 1.13, install requirements and install golang binary itself, the program will be then located in $PATH and you will be able to run the scripts with
```
Alienvault-hids-autodeploy [Options]
```
read documentation below for program usage examples.

## SIEM or Sensor Setup
In the following doc I will refer to "Siem or Sensor" as "sensor" as it didn't make any difference; in fact a Sensor is a subsystem of USM appliance
### Sensor Automatic Setup
For automatically setting up a sensor for deployment you will just need to log in via ssh, "jailbreak" the system (option 2) and run:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucabodd/Alienvault-hids-autodeploy/master/setup/sensor-setup.sh | bash
```
If, for any reason, you don't trust running scripts, read the following "Sensor Manual Setup" section, as the script is doing the exact same thing.

### Sensor Manual Setup
you need to "jailbreak" the system by default setting up .bashrc as follow.

```
# Automatically generated by ossim-reconfig scripts. DO NOT TOUCH!
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.

#File changed: condition from != to ==
if [ "$jailbreak" == "yes" ];then
if [[ $- =~ "i" ]];then
        ossim-setup
exit
fi
fi
export PS1='\h:\w\$ '
umask 022
export LS_OPTIONS='--color=auto'
eval "`dircolors`"
alias ls='ls $LS_OPTIONS'
alias ll='ls $LS_OPTIONS -l'
alias l='ls $LS_OPTIONS -lA'
alias du='du -kh'
alias df='df -kTh'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias rgrep='rgrep --color=auto'
export LC_ALL='C'
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T '
```

please, make sure to backup the original file in order to restore it in future if needed.

create a script under /usr/local/bin named cluster-delete-agent and copy the following code:
```
vi /usr/local/bin/cluster-delete-agent
```
and copy
```
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
	echo "Illegal number of parameters"
	echo "You need to provide onli cluster name or hostname as parameter"
fi
for i in $(/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -l | grep $1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | tr -d ','); do
	/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -r $i;
done  
/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart;
```
add exec permissions
```
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/cluster-delete-agent
```

## Usage
the program may run with the following flags:
```
Usage: Alienvault-hids-deploy [OPTIONS]
One ore more required flag has not been prodided.
Note that using less flag than defined could lead program into errors (not required flags are site-*).
Omit flags only if you are aware of what are you doin'
  -help
    	prints this help message
  -no-copy-id
    	Copy ssh public key to scanned assets. Set this flag if you store RSA public keys not in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. If this flag is set to false password will be written CLEARTEXT in ansible inventory file
  -p string
    	Specify on which ports SSH might be listening on (default "22")
  -sensor-ip string
    	Sensor IP ossec-hids agents should connect to
  -sensor-port string
    	Sensor SSH port (default "22")
  -site-lat string
    	Override geolocation latitude discovery for a site
  -site-long string
    	Override geolocation longitude discovery for a site
  -subnet-cidr string
    	Specify subnet/host CIDR where to install ossec-hids agent

```
